Wow! Can you just imagine that, perhaps, every nook and cranny of the country’s financial district are being shared with the world?!<BR><BR>

2.	It was in 2013 when the local government of Makati first opened the country’s first milk bank that aims to help babies that are deprived of breast milk —the Makati Human Milk Bank. It doesn’t only help Makati residents, but mommies and babies from other cities as well. So, yes, Makati got milk!<BR><BR>

3.	The PSE or Philippine Stock Exchange, has two trading floors – one in Makati and in Ortigas. Back then, PSE traders used blackboards and chalk to process the trading transactions. When the transactions are finished, these are erased from the boards, literally!<BR><BR>

4.	Barangay Pitogo got its name from the ‘pitogo’ plants that are in abundance in thar area before World War II. Pitogo belongs to the Cycas genus, a palm-like plant. See how simple our forefathers in naming a certain place? No fuss and so pragmatic.<BR><BR>
5.	Santa Ana Cabaret, a twentieth-century nightclub was once publicized as the largest cabaret in the world. It was in business from 1921 until 1970. Famous personalities who once visited this entertainment venue were President Manuel Quezon, Gen. Douglas MacArthur, Gov. Gen. Francis Harrison, to name a few. Currently, the Valkyrie nightclub in Taguig is the modern equivalent of the Santa Ana Cabaret.<BR><BR>

6.	In the official seal of Makati City, you can find Guadalupe Church depicted in it. Guadalupe Church is the oldest church in Makati and placing the church in its official seal was in homage to Makati’s Spanish religious influences.<BR><BR>
