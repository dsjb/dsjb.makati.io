          <H2>Ninoy Aquino Monument</H2>
          <IMG SRC="CONTENT/LANDMARKS/LANDMARK Ninoy Aquino Monument.JPG">
          <P>The bronze monument by sculptor Peter de Guzman commemorates slain former senator and Filipino hero Benigno “Ninoy” S. Aquino Jr. As one of the leaders in the opposition against the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, Ninoy protested the social injustices committed during the martial law years and publicly attacked Marcos’ regime. He was assassinated in 1983 at the Manila International Airport. His widow, Corazon “Cory” C. Aquino, became part of the movement to regain democracy in 1985, Cory Aquino ran against Marcos in the snap presidential elections. Despite massive cheating in the polls in favor of Marcos, Cory was sworn in as the first female president of the Philippines through a peaceful People Power Revolution

“NINOY”
Benigno S. Aquino, Jr.
Nov. 27, 1932 – August 21, 1983

Reading his annihilation
In the eyes of his military escorts,
He yet followed them to certain death,
Answering his own question:
“Is the Filipino worth dying for?”

By showing how a man
Can die for his people
He inspired them to stand up
And fight for their freedom.

          <H2>McMicking Memorial & Courtyard</H2>
          <IMG SRC="CONTENT/LANDMARKS/LANDMARK McMicking Memorial & Courtyard.JPG">
          <P>A memorial to Colonel Joseph McMicking and Mrs. Mercedes Zobel-McMicking, who are credited for their significant contributions to the development of Makati’s financial district and the rest of the country, was unveiled recently at the Ayala Triangle Gardens. The courtyard where the memorial now stands was also named the McMicking Courtyard.

The memorial’s art piece, designed by Leandro V. Locsin Partners, in collaboration with Ayala Land and the Zobel family, is made of weathered steel and appears to be arising out of a shallow film of water. Water and light from the portal become a single stream of light traversing the courtyard towards the edge of the Plaza Fountain beneath the grand archway of Ayala’s headquarters, Tower One and Exchange Plaza.

According to the architect’s design brief, “The portal and water represent the union of Col. and Mrs. McMicking, a partnership that brought together the ingredients of visionary resolve and deep humanity that resulted in something much greater than the sum of its individual parts.”

           <H2>Museo ng Makati</H2>
          <IMG SRC="CONTENT/LANDMARKS/LANDMARK Museo ng Makati.JPG">
          <P>The Museo ng Makati on J. P. Rizal Street in Poblacion is the repository of Makati’s heritage and culture. The museo building itself offers a slice of Makati's history. Constructed in 1918, the building served as the town hall of Makati from 1918 until 1961. The history of Makati is shown in a collection of rare photographs, dioramas, and murals.

In March 1990, Ordinance No. 1896 was enacted by the Municipal Council under the administration of Mayor Jejomar C. Binay for the restoration of the old Town Hall for its conversion into a museum called the Museo ng Makati.

A year after, the restoration of the building started. In April 23, 1992, the fully restored building turned into a museum had its blessing, with the ceremony presided by Mayor Jejomar C. Binay. In June 1993, the Tourism and Cultural Affairs Division, now the City Museum and Cultural Affairs Office, moved in to manage the Museo's operations.

The Museo served as the community museum where the artifacts, treasures, and relics of the city's historical and cultural heritage are housed and preserved. It is the only museum in Metro Manila that showcases the city's history in relics especially carved for the Museo.

One of the museum's special features is the "living" exhibit of the different regions of the country, showcasing the unique attributes of each region. There are cultural presentations, and art & crafts demonstrations during special events.

The Museum is located in J. P. Rizal Street, Poblacion, Makati City.
