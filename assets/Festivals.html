          <P>Fête de la Musique 2018 Manila
For 24 years, the Philippines has been hosting its own edition of Fête de la Musique. While we can’t exactly apply the same concept France uses for their own Fête (we’re not that big on busking here in the Philippines), what we have done is make the best out of what we have: the many bars, open areas, and event venues in the city of Makati.
The way we have Fête set-up in the country may not be the same as other countries, but it stays true to what the music festival is about: the music everywhere and the concert nowhere. It’s a celebration of life more than music, a way for both bystander and artist to express their feelings through a tune or performance.
This year’s Fête features 39 stages, with the main stage divided between two venues: Greenbelt 3 Park and the A-Venue Mall Parking Lot. Performing at Greenbelt 3 this year are Brass Pas Pas Pas Pas with former Dicta License vocalist Pochoy Labog, Tukar Sinati feat. Radha, and Kjwan. A-Venue, meanwhile, plays host to Ourselves the Elves, Orange and Lemons, and Toni B.

          <P>Brasilipinas
” It is no secret that I love to dance. And Brasilipinas has got to be one of the most fun parties we've been to as a family. Think of a street party bursting with samba and reggae beats, Brazilian food and drinks, beautiful people, and with things to do for the little ones as well.

Brasilipinas is an annual celebration of Brazilian and Filipino cultures, brought to you by Escola Brasileira de Capoeira Philippines. Rockwell will once again turn a little Brazilian on May 20, 2017!”
